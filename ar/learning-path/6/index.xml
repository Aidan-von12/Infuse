Adversaries attack these web applications for various purposes, including shutting down the free flow of information, reputational damage, access to private systems, theft of sensitive information, surveillance, and device compromise. By preparing effectively for these sorts of attacks, you can reduce their impact, or in some cases prevent them entirely.</description></item><item><title>Website Hardening</title><link>https://infuse.quest/ar/learning-path/6/module-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://infuse.quest/ar/learning-path/6/module-1/</guid><description>Use Case There are a number of steps that can be taken to a website as a whole to make it more resilient to attack. These typically require less effort than going through the site page-by-page and can be quite impactful, so generally it’s a good idea to go through these actions first.
Objectives After completing this subtopic, the practitioner should be able to do the following:
Use development and maintenance processes that ensure that their site can be re-created if the production hosting servers are unavailable.</description></item><item><title>Website Logging for Security</title><link>https://infuse.quest/ar/learning-path/6/module-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://infuse.quest/ar/learning-path/6/module-2/</guid><description>Use Case Any website that’s exposed to the internet is under constant attack. At the very least, it’s being deluged by undirected attacks by hordes of robots operated by criminal actors. More concerning are targeted attacks; even unskilled attackers, given perseverance and luck, can find vulnerabilities in a website.
Ideally, the website owner should be able to be aware of the threats they are facing. Site owners especially will want to know if an attacker is close to finding, or has recently found, a vulnerability in their site.</description></item><item><title>Denial of Service Incident Response</title><link>https://infuse.quest/ar/learning-path/6/module-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://infuse.quest/ar/learning-path/6/module-3/</guid><description>Use Case If a website comes under a sustained denial of service attack, it may be vital to act quickly to get the site back up and running. This Learning Path describes some practices to allow site owners to recover from a DoS attack.

At the very least, the site owners need to identify how the site was initially compromised so that they can fix any vulnerabilities that enabled that. It may also be important to know what data the attackers may have accessed or modified. This learning path describes some practices to help investigate and recover from a website hacking incident.</description></item></channel></rss>
